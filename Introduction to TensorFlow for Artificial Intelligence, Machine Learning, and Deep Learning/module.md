# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

You will need these packages if you will run the notebooks locally:

```
tensorflow==2.7.0  
scikit-learn==1.0.1  
pandas==1.1.5  
matplotlib==3.2.2  
seaborn==0.11.2  
```

### From Rules to Data

The traditional paradigm of expressing rules in a coding language may not always work to solve a problem. As such, applications such as computer vision are very difficult to solve with rules-based programming. Instead, if we feed a computer with enough data that we describe (or label) as what we want it to recognize -- given that computers are really good at processing data and matching patterns -- then we could potentially ‘train’ a system to solve a problem.
